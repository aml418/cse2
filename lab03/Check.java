//The user has gone out to dinner with friends. After they receive the bill, they decide to split the check evenly. 
//We need the following infomation in order to calculate
//the original cost of the check
//the percentage tip they wish to pay
//the number of ways the check will be split
//how much each person in the group needs to spend in order to pay the check.

//import the scanner

        double checkCost = myScanner.nextDouble();
        //prompt the user for the tip percentage that they wish to pay and accept the input.
        System.out.print("Enter the percentage tip that you wish to pay as a whole number:");
        double tipPercent = myScanner.nextDouble();
        //prompt the user for the number of people that went of to dinner and accept the input.
        System.out.print("Enter the number of people who went out to dinner:");
